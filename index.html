    <p>As we move forward into 2017, we are seeing the landscape of design evolve into a more human-centered, experience-based profession. Design has shifted from its traditional practices of only ink and paper and progressed into creating world changing connections. Continuing the theme of future forward thinking, HIVE 2017 will focus directly on improving technological and social advances using various design techniques. Seminar topics will range from virtual reality and artificial intelligence to social justice and communication design. You will hear from local and national experts who have established best practices in using their design skill sets in a way which shapes and encourages positive change.</p>

    <p>HIVE 2017 will be held in Seattle Washington this coming May 2017, attracting 200-250 attendees from around the country, with a majority being from the surrounding cities of Portland, Seattle and Vancouver. As in previous years, we expect to sell out quickly once tickets go on sale. Speaking opportunities available for HIVE 2017 are limited, and will be chosen by select AIGA Seattle directors as well as the HIVE committee. We encourage both AIGA and non-AIGA members who have an interest in speaking and participating in this incredible event to submit an application. Submissions must be written in English. Final submissions will be accepted via an interactive PDF that will be made available <span class="deadline">December 30, 2016 through January 27, 2017.</span></p>
